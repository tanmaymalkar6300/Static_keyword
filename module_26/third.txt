No, you cannot mark a local variable as static in Java. The static keyword is only applicable to class-level variables and methods. Local variables, which are declared inside methods, constructors, or blocks, cannot be static. This is because static implies a single shared instance for all objects of the class, whereas local variables are specific to a single invocation of a method or block.

* Explanation:-
Static Variables: Belong to the class and are shared among all instances of that class. They are defined at the class level and exist for the lifetime of the class.
Local Variables: Exist only within the scope of a method, constructor, or block. They are created when the method or block is entered and destroyed when the method or block is exited.
